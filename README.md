### Game of Life

Conway's Game of life cellular automata implemented in Unity.

#### Rules:

1. If a cell is alive, it survives to the next generation if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors; otherwise it
   dies.
2.  If a cell is dead, it comes to life in the next generation if it has exactly 3 live neighbors; otherwise
   it stays dead.
